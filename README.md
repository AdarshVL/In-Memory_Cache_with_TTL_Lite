## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Java-based **in-memory key-value cache system** designed to simulate core functionalities of real-world caching systems like Redis.

It demonstrates how data can be **stored, retrieved, expired, and monitored efficiently** using fundamental data structures and system design principles.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The goal is to build a high-performance cache system that supports:

* Fast key-value storage and retrieval
* Time-based expiration (TTL)
* Manual data deletion
* Performance tracking (hits & misses)
* Reporting of active keys

The system processes commands dynamically and returns results in a structured format.

---

## 🔥 Features

### ✅ Core Functionalities

* **SET** → Store key-value pair
* **GET** → Retrieve value
* **DELETE** → Remove key
* **PASS** → Simulate time
* **REPORT** → Show active keys

### ⏳ Advanced Features

* TTL (Time-To-Live) expiration
* Lazy deletion of expired keys
* Alphabetical sorting of keys
* JSON-like output formatting

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* HashMap (Key-Value Storage)
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Time Simulation Logic
* Sorting Algorithms
* String Parsing
* System Design Basics

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

* Each key is stored with a value and expiry time
* A simulated time (`currentTime`) is maintained
* TTL is calculated as:

```
expiry = currentTime + ttl
```

* Expired keys are removed when accessed
* REPORT filters and displays only active keys

---

## 📥 Input Format

Commands are given line-by-line:

```text
SET key value ttl
GET key
DELETE key
PASS time
REPORT
```

---

## 📤 Output Format

All outputs follow this structure:

```json
[{"key":["output1"]},{"key":["output2"]}]
```

---

## 📊 Sample Input

```
SET a 1 100
SET b 2 200
GET a
PASS 50
GET b
PASS 100
GET a
DELETE b
GET b
REPORT
```

---

## 📊 Sample Output

```json
[
 {"key":["OK"]},
 {"key":["OK"]},
 {"key":["1"]},
 {"key":["TIME_PASSED"]},
 {"key":["2"]},
 {"key":["TIME_PASSED"]},
 {"key":["NULL"]},
 {"key":["DELETED"]},
 {"key":["NULL"]},
 {"key":["[]"]}
]
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

### Step 1: Compile

```bash
javac Solution.java
```

### Step 2: Run

```bash
java Solution
```

### Step 3: Provide Input

You can:

* Enter commands manually
* OR use file input:

```bash
java Solution < sample_input.txt
```
